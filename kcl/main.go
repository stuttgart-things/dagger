// A generated module for KCL functions
//
// This module provides KCL (KCL Configuration Language) functionality through Dagger.
// It includes functions to run KCL code, validate configurations, and test the KCL CLI.
//
// KCL is a constraint-based record and functional language hosted by CNCF that enhances
// the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios.
