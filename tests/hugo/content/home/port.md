- 🧭 Build a catalog of services from GitHub repos automatically
- 🔁 Create golden paths that use GitHub Actions to scaffold new services

---

### 📦 Your Central Source of Truth

- ✅ No more switching between tools
- 🧭 Hierarchical service mapping
- 🔗 Easy access to dependencies & metadata
- 🗂️ Consolidated software catalog

---


## 🐞 Fixing an Urgent Bug

- 🔗 Start with the GitHub issue — all context is there.
- 🔍 Then check the **Port service page**:
  - Owner & on-call info
  - Last commit details
  - Linked cloud resources
  - Docs & integrations

---

## 🤝 Visibility & Ownership

- 👥 Know who’s responsible — fast
- 💬 Onboard teammates or escalate instantly
- 📈 Product owners & business units can:
  - Check status at any time
  - Skip back-and-forth with dev teams

---

### 🚀 /WHY GITHUB IS USING PORT

> One platform to answer key operational questions:

- 📍 **Where is my service running?**
- 🔁 **Which services will be impacted by my features?**
- ⚠️ **Which SLOs are not being met by my team?**
- 👤 **Who owns a service?**
- 🧾 **Who made the last change in production?**

Port centralizes this data — giving teams **clarity, ownership, and impact awareness** across the software lifecycle.

---


### Core Concepts in Port

- **Blueprints**: Define schemas (e.g., service, environment)
- **Software Catalog**: Metadata-rich inventory of resources
- **Scorecards**: Maturity, reliability & security evaluations
- **Automations**: Self-service workflows triggered by events

---

# Use Cases

1. Spin up new microservices with golden templates
2. Automate environment provisioning
3. Enforce compliance with scorecards
4. Visualize K8s deployments and ownership
5. Centralize developer onboarding

---

# Tracking Developer Adoption

- ✔️ Service creation events
- ✔️ Workflow usage metrics
- ✔️ Scorecard completion
- ✔️ Catalog contribution

Use these to **measure value and improve platform fit**

---

# Example: Create a New Service

🧩 Blueprint: `service`
🖥 Form: Choose language, repo, infra
⚙️ Automation: Scaffold code, set up CI, register in catalog

🎯 Developer gets a ready-to-use repo and pipeline in minutes

---

# Summary

Port helps platform teams:

- ✅ Build developer self-service
- ✅ Codify best practices
- ✅ Connect the DevOps toolchain
- ✅ Visualize and measure adoption
